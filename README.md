# Cub3d
First-person 3D representation of a maze using raycasting, similar to Wolfenstein 3D (1992).
### Prerequisites
The project runs using the miniLibx_linux, a simplified version of the Xlib. It can therefore only run in ubuntu.

### The mandatory part
The basic program that was required to pass. It only includes wall textures and a sprite ; no floor/ceiling textures, no weapons, no enemies, no game elements at all.

### How to run it
Using make test will make and run the mandatory part.

You can also use make to generate the cub3D executable. You can launch it with (./cub3D .cubfile).

### Controls
Controls are the same as the project with bonuses, but only (W) (A) (S) (D) to move and (←) (→) to turn are available.
